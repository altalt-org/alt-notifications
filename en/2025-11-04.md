Hello!

I'm Sangwoo Ye from the Alt team.

We've received reports that on certain devices (M1 Pro), loading the model can take a long time.
We believe this is related to the M1's ANE, and we're currently working on a fix.
As a temporary workaround, please open Activity Monitor and force quit the ANECompilerService process 2–3 times; this should resolve the issue.
We'll resolve this soon so you can use it without inconvenience.

If you have any additional issues or questions, please report them at https://www.altalt.io/en/feedback!
