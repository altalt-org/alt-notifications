Hello!

This is Sangwoo Ye from the Alt team.

We've resolved the power consumption issue! You can now use Alt with an average power consumption of around 4 watts.

If you fully charge your battery, you can transcribe about 9 hours of lectures on a Pro MacBook in ideal conditions.

Also, when stopping recording, it took a long time to restart, but we've resolved this issue as well.

If your battery usage is still high, please check in the Menu bar under Alt -> about alt to see if the version is the latest version 0.0.17, and if the auto-update notification doesn't appear, we recommend downloading the latest version from https://www.altalt.io/

Best regards,
Sangwoo Ye
