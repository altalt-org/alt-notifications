Hello!

This is Sangwoo Ye from the Alt team.

First of all, thank you for using our product!

Currently, there's an issue where laptops are overheating and batteries are draining quickly while using the app. This is a bug that occurred during an update.

If this is causing inconvenience during class, we plan to fix it by the 13th, so please check again then!

Best regards,
Sangwoo Ye
